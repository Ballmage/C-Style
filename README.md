# C# at Me Style Guide
This style guide is for C# code developed by me.
Rule summary:

Code
Names of classes, methods, enumerations, public fields, public properties, namespaces: PascalCase.
Names of local variables, parameters: camelCase.
Names of private, protected, internal and protected internal fields and properties: _camelCase.
Naming convention is unaffected by modifiers such as const, static, readonly, etc.
For casing, a “word” is anything written without internal spaces, including acronyms. For example, MyRpc instead of MyRPC.
Names of interfaces start with I, e.g. IInterface.
